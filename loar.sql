He added, “We don’t have to raise billions of dollars to run a free consumer service.”&nbsp;</p><p>Current clients include Notion, Oracle and Bamboo HR, according to Cohere’s website.

He calls it “tool use,” and it involves training models on where, when and how to look for information that an enterprise client needs, even if the model wasn’t trained on that data originally.&nbsp;</p><p>Search, Kon said, is a key piece of generative AI that’s getting less attention than other areas.</p><p>“That’s certainly, for enterprise, going to be the real unlock,” he said.</p><p>In discussing the timeline for expansion, Kon called 2023 “the year of the the proof of concept.”&nbsp;</p><p>“We think 2024 is turning into the year of deployment at scale,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Don’t miss these stories from CNBC PRO:</strong></em></p><ul><li><em>Berkshire Hathaway is one of the most overbought stocks on Wall Street.

The company’s convoluted “capped-profit” structure resulted in Altman being briefly ousted by the board late last year, before an uproar among investors and employees led to his quick reinstatement.</p><p>Musk has long wanted recognition for his central role in the creation of OpenAI, and he spent large chunks of the lawsuit telling his version of events. His lawyers said in the suit that Musk was approached in 2015 by Altman and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman and agreed to form a nonprofit lab that would develop artificial general intelligence, or AGI, outside of the corporate sphere.</p><p>Musk’s attorneys said their client contributed over $15 million to OpenAI in 2016, which was “more than any other donor” and helped the startup build a team of “top talent.” The next year, Musk gave nearly $20 million to OpenAI, which the attorneys reiterated was more than other backers. In total, Musk invested over $44 million into OpenAI from 2016 through September 2020, according to the suit.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>Additionally, Musk leased OpenAI’s initial office space “and paid the monthly rental expenses,” the suit said. He was also “present for important company milestones.”</p><p>Kwon didn’t dispute Musk’s central role in the early days of OpenAI, but he added some other details. For example, Kwon wrote that Musk at one point indicated he needed “full initial control and majority equity” and later suggested that OpenAI merge with Tesla.</p><p>“We did not think either approach was right for the mission,” Kwon wrote.</p><p>In the memo, Altman called Musk a hero of his and said the he misses the old version of his co-founder. But he said the company’s mission continues.  </p><p>While it’s the first time the dispute between the two sides has resulted in a fiery lawsuit, they’ve been at odds for a while. </p><p>Before he split with OpenAI, Tesla hired co-founder Andrej Karpathy as senior director of AI. Karpathy returned to OpenAI in 2023.

(89,	'',	'策解．旅遊｜當反消費主義的「城市漫步」遇上消費主義盛行的香港',	'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;「City Walk」最初在國外興起，被視為緩解「過度旅遊開發」（Overtourism）的手段，通常以導賞團（Walking Tour）形式進行：一兩位講解員帶領遊客在非傳統旅遊景點中步行，探索城市的自然和人文景觀。去年，「City Walk」成為內地社交媒體上的現象級話題，並且不再侷限於導賞團的形式，而是強調以步行方式和較低消費，追求小眾和非主流敘事。根據「小紅書」去年7月發佈的《小紅書City Walk趨勢報告》，「City Walk」已經演變成為泛指一切「走來走去找快樂的行為」。報告還指出，第一則「City Walk」貼文早在2016年已經出現。那麼，它為什麼在去年突然成為現象級的話題？<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;消費模式的改變是最直接的催動力。無論是餐飲、購物還是旅遊，越來越多人分享怎樣花更少的錢而獲得更滿足的消費體驗。有人將其歸因為「消費降級」，也有人認為是消費觀念轉變帶來的「反向消費」、「消費分級」，但客觀結果都是消費金額減少。背後的成因或許可以從更廣闊的社會層面去分析，內地人類學家項飆提出「附近的消失」概念，說我們超越了具體而繁瑣的生活之後，周邊的生活好像離我們遠去了。他指出，物流、外賣等平台和居住模式在確保安全和方便的同時，也建立了不需要與周邊的他人進行互動，就能夠滿足吃住出行等需求的陌生人社會。這一概念得到許多人的認同，尤其是新冠疫情封控期間，人們被迫通過鄰里互助的形式生存，也讓大家重新意識到與「附近」建立關係的重要性；於是在防疫結束後，「漫步」便成為探索附近的方式之一。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;當「City Walk」成為內地年輕遊客的新寵，以內地人作為主要客源的香港旅遊業，也不得不想方設法迎合這種全新的旅遊方式。小紅書等社交平台是年輕人出行偏好的風向標，香港旅遊發展局顯然看到這一趨勢，也早已在小紅書、豆瓣、微博等社交媒體平台發佈推廣內容。例如旅發局與小紅書合作推出「香港漫步指南」活動，介紹五條具有特色的香港旅行路線，分別括山海漫步、博物漫步、霓虹漫步、塗鴉漫步和文藝漫步。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;《2024-25財政預算案》就提到，旅發局會推動以「城市漫步」等為主題的沉浸式深度遊，亦會針對年青客群喜好，透過例如推廣遠足、單車、直立板、越野跑以至野外觀星等嶄新內容「軟銷」香港。不過，香港引入「City Walk」之際，未知曾否認真探究其演變歷程和興起因由，以及香港是否具備相關土壤？例如，與內地所面臨的「附近的消失」恰恰相反，香港是高密度城市，滿佈食肆商鋪，人們的日常購物和消費基本都可以在「附近」完成，實體經濟仍很繁榮，社區也有活力；同時，香港消費主義大行其道，但City Walk本身具備反消費主義的色彩，似乎不能爲旅遊業帶來太多直接的經濟效益。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;《2024-25財政預算案》還提出，將以「盛事活動」和「主題年會」打造香港旅遊品牌。乍看之下，是要塑造一個高端、繁華的國際都市。然而，這又與「City Walk」的邏輯不太吻合。長期以來，訪港遊客的消費場景主要集中於高檔商場和連鎖商鋪，根據旅發局的統計，2018及2019年的過夜遊客都有約五成的消費用在購物；對於沒有過夜的遊客，購物佔比更是超過八成。但「City Walk」導向的關注對象不是「盛事」或「大商場」，而是「市井文化」。內地「City Walk」流行的路段，正是一些具備城市風味的老城區或城中村，而不是市中心的寬馬路、高樓房。這也不免令人疑惑，當官方進場，為原本提倡漫無目的城市探索編寫漫步指南，會否消解隨心所欲、反主流敘事的新奇感？<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;去年特區政府推出不少振興旅遊業的舉措，但遺憾的是許多活動都備受爭議。以美食博覽、廟街夜市為例，該些活動本來以小販文化和本土風情作為賣點，結果卻出現販售食物缺乏特色、價格偏高等問題；與此同時，食物環境衛生署也持續打擊無牌熟食小販，變相扼殺那種自下而上誕生的「夜文化」。當局一邊推廣，一邊清除，做法與推廣「城市漫步」同時塑造香港國際都會形象的邏輯相似，好像「市井文化」只有在被官方收編之後才具備正當性，否則就是阻礙市容，不利於經濟高速發展，需要被淘汰的產物。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;早於2013年，香港已經引入「City Walk」的概念，不少社企、博物館和民間保育群體都會推出步行導賞活動，只是官方從不重視。2017年11月15日，時任立法會會計界議員梁繼昌便就香港發展步行導賞團提出質詢，商務及經濟發展局局長邱騰華僅回覆表示，未有打算針對有關業務設立發牌制度，但政府一直支持業界提供不同旅遊產品。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;及後數年，「City Walk」的熱度在本土思潮激盪的語境中升溫；而在新冠疫情期間，由於邊境限制不能外遊，不少市民也開始發掘在香港散步的樂趣。城市研究學者黃宇軒撰寫的《香港散步學》和《城市散步學》兩本書，在過去兩年頻頻登上暢銷書榜單。然而，越來越多特色景觀正在消失：現存流動小販牌照不到300個，大排檔只剩20多間，五年內有1.6萬個霓虹燈被拆卸，深水埗「棚仔」要拆遷，文化博物館也不保⋯⋯如今當局突然大力推廣「City Walk」，但在很多市井文化都已所剩無幾的情況下，難免令人擔心，香港還有什麼在地的街頭文化可以吸引外來遊客？<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;美國籍加拿大記者、作家珍·雅各（Jane Jacobs）將自己對美國都市街道的觀察，撰寫為《偉大城市的誕生與衰亡》一書，批評1950年代主流的城市規劃理念影響深遠。她指出，統一規劃建成的街區無法維持多樣性，到最後都容易衰落，反而是小馬路、高密度的街道更有活力：「城市產生的多樣性，不管是哪一種，事實上是因為城市裡有許多人緊密地聚在一起，他們又包含了許多不同的品味、技能、需求、供給和狂熱。」<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;因此，「City Walk」帶來的不僅是更多的遊客，更是人流量對商業型態的重塑。當城市規劃為人的活動預留空間時，商業活動便自然會發生——對於消費場景集中於封閉商場的香港來說，這是一次資源重新分配的機會，更是一次重新思考城市規劃的機會。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2010年代，城市研究逐漸重視「人本交通」的意義，並引入步行友好度（Walkability）的概念，根據一個地區中不用開車就能到達附近的商店、學校和公園的可能性及數量，判斷該地區適合步行的程度。許多歐美國家也在反思以汽車為中心的道路規劃，着力提升步行友好度、打造「步行城市」。「步行城市」的受益對象不僅是旅遊觀光活動，更是本地居民的日常生活，因為它是更加可持續的城市規劃，能夠減少汽車碳排放，為老齡化人口打造無障礙化出行環境，幫助外來人口增加與附近的互動、更快融入社區。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;香港「窄馬路、密路網」的規劃，具備打造「步行城市」的基礎，同時由於地少人多，旅遊業界接待能力有限，過度開發的矛盾早有顯現。值得一提的是，「City Walk」在內地火爆後，也引發不少批評，有聲音認為它只是中產階級對「逛街」的偽裝，所謂的深度體驗不過是將城市人文作為「被凝視的景觀」，僅僅具有打卡拍照的意義，或只是帶動文青咖啡店等場景的消費。如果港府只是將「城市漫步」包裝成為時尚的打卡路線，藉以推廣旅遊業，而忽視這亦是對市井文化發展、城市規劃和文旅資源分配進行反思的好時機，那麼最終打造的或許是徒有「國際大都會」空殼、沒有文化內涵的香港。',	'2024-03-06 05:00:35.492',	NULL,	'HKEX',	'策解．旅遊｜當反消費主義的「城市漫步」遇上消費主義盛行的香港',	'https://cdn.hk01.com/di/media/images/dw/20240305/841714534065377280957861.jpeg/SOM3YXO95z-Bu78FHqjNJ0Fzm9cZ8aFDCopXlgqKV5Y?v=w1920r16_9'),

This has already been in place, enabling the likes of Microsoft, Ecosia, and DuckDuckGo to get a place in a list of multiple search engine providers.</p><p>Google recently added even more choice screens.

Cargo containers once bound for the East Coast are now beginning to head back to the West Coast to mitigate any service disruptions, a reversal of what occurred in 2022 and 2023, when East Coast ports made major gains in cargo volume due to both the massive vessel congestion and labor strife at ports up and down the West Coast.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>U.S. importers are meeting with ocean carriers this week kicking off their contract negotiations. Between March and April, one-year contracts are inked between U.S. importers and ocean carriers to get their best ocean freight rate.</p><p>The ILA’s master contract with the United States Maritime Alliance — which represents terminal operators and ocean carriers — is set to expire Sept. 31, but May 17 is the cutoff date set by the union for the local contracts to be agreed to so an overall master contract can then be negotiated. Negotiations for the six-year contract officially began last month.</p><p>All East Coast and Gulf Coast cargo is moved by the ILA, which hasn’t gone on strike since 1977, when a work stoppage lasted 44 days.</p><p>During the West Coast International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) contract negotiations between 2022-2023, freight processing was stalled after a series of intentional labor slowdowns and walk-offs. At the ILWU Canadian West Coast Ports, a 13-day strike resulted in over $12 billion in trade stuck at sea and it took months for the back of containers to be cleared out.</p><p>The current ILA contract has union members making a range of $20-$37 an hour. Depending on seniority, skill rate, hazard pay, overtime differential, plus tonnage bonus (which can be anywhere between $15,000-$20,000 a year), a longshoreman can make between $150,000-$250,000 annually.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>One of the differences between the ILA and their West Coast brethren, the ILWU, is the ILA longshoremen receive royalties based on how much tonnage they process in a year at their port. This compensation model makes it in the best interest of the ILA workers not to have cargo diverted or their bonuses will decrease. On the West Coast, longshoremen accrue additional compensation based on man-hour assessments.</p><p>Port insiders believe the ILA is targeting an increase larger than the 32% that was negotiated by the ILWU in its new six-year contract. The ILA is also said to be looking to secure a generous bonus package.</p><p>In July, the ILA leadership pointed to the Great Lakes District of the union, which secured a 40% increase in wages and benefits for its new six-year contract.&nbsp;No definitive salary increase target has been made by the ILA.</p><p>ILA International president Harold Daggett has said he wants a good economic deal for his members, which includes union opposition to port automation and exclusive port contracts for its members. During a speech before union members in July 2023, Daggett vowed the ILA would not take a back seat to anyone. “It’s time for foreign companies like Maersk and MSC to realize that you need us as much as we need you,” he said.</p><p>Daggett’s office told CNBC it had no comment at this time.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>To thwart local union disputes, which massively slowed down the West Coast port negotiations and contributed to a 13-month delay, the ILA is tackling the local issues first before the master contract. So far, the ports of New York/New Jersey and Baltimore have reached tentative local agreements, according to the ILA.</p><p>“We are very pleased the ILA has returned back to the table for local bargaining,” said Dave Adam, chairman and CEO of USMX. “75% of the contract negotiation workload is the local contract. We look forward to getting back to the table to discuss the Master contract issues.”</p><h3 class=\"ArticleBody-smallSubtitle\">A move of cargo back to the West Coast</h3><p>But East Coast trade is flowing away from the ports in the meantime as a result of ongoing Panama Canal restrictions due to drought, the Red Sea diversions, and the threat of a strike.</p><p>Michael Aldwell, executive vice president for <span class=\"QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer\" data-test=\"QuoteInBody\" id=\"SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-5\">Kuehne + Nagel<span class=\"QuoteInBody-inlineButton\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer\" id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\" data-analytics-id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\"><button class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton\" aria-label=\"Add To Watchlist\" data-testid=\"dropdown-btn\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag\"></span></button></span></span></span>, says it is tracking a double-digit shift in cargo moving away from the East Coast and advising clients to have an established method of getting cargo into the U.S. in advance of a labor crisis.</p><p>“As a result of these uncertainties, our customers are telling us they need options, and they need options before it’s a necessity to try and grab capacity,” said Aldwell. “So we’re counseling our customers, take the opportunity while there’s no congestion, while there’s no risk. And it is playing out already. Move some of your cargo so you establish a transload supply chain via the West Coast,” which ultimately travels back by truck and rail to the East Coast and Gulf Coast.</p><p>Other logistics companies confirmed the trend.</p><p>“We are seeing a significant change back to the U.S. West Coast,” said Paul Brashier, vice president of drayage and intermodal for ITS Logistics. “I would say 25% of our client’s freight is coming back to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.”</p><p>The movement of trade away from the East Coast influences the volume of freight moving on the rails, with the extra containers a tailwind for Union Pacific and BNSF, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, which previously saw a decrease in containers being moved.</p><p>Beth Whited, president of <span class=\"QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer\" data-test=\"QuoteInBody\" id=\"SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-6\">Union Pacific<span class=\"QuoteInBody-inlineButton\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer\" id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\" data-analytics-id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\"><button class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton\" aria-label=\"Add To Watchlist\" data-testid=\"dropdown-btn\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag\"></span></button></span></span></span>, said she thinks that the labor negotiations with the ILA could push freight back to the West Coast, and the Panama Canal could cause some trade to come out of the Gulf and be pushed back to the West Coast.</p><p>“Right now that is just fractional,” said Whited. “But as the shipping community continues to make decisions about where they want their freight to land for their comfort and certainty of supply, we’ll see how that works out ... we’re going to be ready to handle it if that’s what happens.”</p><p>Mario Cordero, executive director of the Port of Long Beach, which recently reported its fifth consecutive month of freight volume increase, tells CNBC it is forecasting the annual volume trend to at least match and likely exceed the pre-Covid 2019 number of 6.3 million twenty-foot equivalent (TEU) container units.</p><p>“We are forecasting an escalation by the end of the year,” said Cordero. “Just to put it into context, we moved 8.1 million [TEUs] last year. This year we believe we might get up to 8.4 million.”</p><h3 class=\"ArticleBody-smallSubtitle\">Preparing for labor strife, but a history of strikes averted</h3><p>Charles Van der Steene, president of Maersk North America, told CNBC on the sidelines of the recent TPM Conference in California — where shippers and ocean carriers met and discussed their contracts — that all of this is factoring into peak contract negotiation season with customers.</p><p>“We see on an ongoing basis the question emerging as to what level should we be ready to potentially make decisions for different inland locations, for different routing of our cargo,” said Van der Steene. “And how do we then prepare for that as part of the contract? So it’s a part of the discussion, but at this stage, it’s again not dissimilar from the same preparations that were had for the negotiations on the West Coast.”</p><p>One of the strategies being suggested by logistics experts for their East Coast freight customers is to bring in containers for peak shipping season early, starting in June versus July.</p><p>“We’re certainly having a lot of conversations with customers right now to make those decisions early, to, to maybe pull in a little more stock earlier in the summer,” said Tim Robertson, CEO of DHL Global Forwarding Americas. “So you’re not caught up in any potential disruption, and to get access to some of the West Coast routing. These are the discussions that we’re having, right now, and I fully expect you’re going to see many shippers start to move that way, I would say, in the coming months.”</p><p>Lars Ostergaard, head of Americas liner operations at Maersk, says it is planning ahead itself and keeping a close eye on the negotiations.</p><p>“As of now, we’re advising people to continue using the East Coast, said Ostergaard. “There could be issues when you get beyond October 1, but obviously no one at this point in time knows if that’s the case. So what we are advising our clients to do is to think about potentially, if possible, to pre-move some cargo, particularly because you come into the holiday season at the back of the year, and that it would make sense to think about,” he said. “Are there certain items that are critical for that season that perhaps, if possible, you should actually try and move before the end of September if possible?”</p><p>Ostergaard said customers are generally thinking about supply chains in a very different way than they did pre-pandemic, and are concerned about delays.</p><p>Mike Hatfield, senior manager of global logistics for Berlin Packing, which imports glass bottles, said the lessons learned during Covid enabled the company to quickly mitigate risk of a strike or slowdown.</p><p>“We learned we are not tied down to just going to the West Coast, East Coast, and support volume to other ports in the event the East Coast shuts down,” said Hatfield. “We know we can go back into the West Coast rail product, truck product cross country, so it’s just making sure that we have diversity within our supply chain, within our partners, within our contracts for multiple routings of similar lanes. A little bit of redundancy can go a long way.”</p><p>D’Andrae Larry, head of intermodal for <span class=\"QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer\" data-test=\"QuoteInBody\" id=\"SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-7\">Uber<span class=\"QuoteInBody-inlineButton\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer\" id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\" data-analytics-id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\"><button class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton\" aria-label=\"Add To Watchlist\" data-testid=\"dropdown-btn\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag\"></span></button></span></span></span> Freight, tells CNBC that more customers are coming to him saying they want to plan for the “what if.”</p><p>“We’ve learned that optionality is the order of tomorrow,” he said.</p><p>Cargo owners at TPM indicated a need for more data and the ability to start plugging that into predictive analytics, according to Chris Rogers, head of supply chain for S&amp;P Global.</p><p>“We know what a disrupted system looks like,” said Rogers. “We’ve seen behaviorally what happened during the pandemic and how the ports kind of hit capacity, particularly here on the West Coast. I think one of the other challenges with the labor situation is we’re also running into the elections. And so this whole thing around labor becoming very politicized.”</p><p>That’s a global phenomenon, Rogers said. “We are also seeing protests in lots of different countries linked to politics that have an impact on logistics networks. Fingers crossed, cooler minds will prevail and we’ll get a solution well ahead of time. It’s in no one’s interest to disrupt shipping during peak season, but we’ve got a little way to go before we get there,” he added.</p><p>So far, labor talks are progressing at the local level, says Daniel Walsh, CEO of TRAC Intermodal, North America’s leading marine chassis pool manager and equipment provider, and the parties are talking.</p><p>“I think that if you look at the history, there seems to be a shared understanding that a strike is not really in anyone’s interest, and it’s best to avoid that if possible,” said Walsh. “They’re working pretty, pretty aggressively towards that sort of a conclusion. Hopefully, they can be able to manage it.”</p><p>Lars Jensen, CEO of Vespucci Maritime, said he is hopeful that history will repeat itself in this case. ILA negotiations in the past have not led to many major disruptions and he anticipates no major changes to the normal pattern of West Coast trade. “The risk [of a strike] is, of course, always there. But historically there has been more success in those negotiations than what you’ve seen with the ILWU on the West Coast.&nbsp;Peak season might start slightly earlier. Again, people might be concerned about the stability of the supply chains,” he said.</p>',	'2024-03-07 21:00:18.131',	NULL,	'US',	'Concerns about union strikes at East Coast, Gulf ports rise, leading to trade diversions',	'https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107227028-1681828414571-gettyimages-1247247361-AA_18022023_1072021.jpeg?v=1709833924&w=929&h=523&vtcrop=y'),

Depending on seniority, skill rate, hazard pay, overtime differential, plus tonnage bonus (which can be anywhere between $15,000-$20,000 a year), a longshoreman can make between $150,000-$250,000 annually.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>One of the differences between the ILA and their West Coast brethren, the ILWU, is the ILA longshoremen receive royalties based on how much tonnage they process in a year at their port. This compensation model makes it in the best interest of the ILA workers not to have cargo diverted or their bonuses will decrease. On the West Coast, longshoremen accrue additional compensation based on man-hour assessments.</p><p>Port insiders believe the ILA is targeting an increase larger than the 32% that was negotiated by the ILWU in its new six-year contract. The ILA is also said to be looking to secure a generous bonus package.</p><p>In July, the ILA leadership pointed to the Great Lakes District of the union, which secured a 40% increase in wages and benefits for its new six-year contract.&nbsp;No definitive salary increase target has been made by the ILA.</p><p>ILA International president Harold Daggett has said he wants a good economic deal for his members, which includes union opposition to port automation and exclusive port contracts for its members. During a speech before union members in July 2023, Daggett vowed the ILA would not take a back seat to anyone. “It’s time for foreign companies like Maersk and MSC to realize that you need us as much as we need you,” he said.</p><p>Daggett’s office told CNBC it had no comment at this time.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>To thwart local union disputes, which massively slowed down the West Coast port negotiations and contributed to a 13-month delay, the ILA is tackling the local issues first before the master contract. So far, the ports of New York/New Jersey and Baltimore have reached tentative local agreements, according to the ILA.</p><p>“We are very pleased the ILA has returned back to the table for local bargaining,” said Dave Adam, chairman and CEO of USMX. “75% of the contract negotiation workload is the local contract. We look forward to getting back to the table to discuss the Master contract issues.”</p><h3 class=\"ArticleBody-smallSubtitle\">A move of cargo back to the West Coast</h3><p>But East Coast trade is flowing away from the ports in the meantime as a result of ongoing Panama Canal restrictions due to drought, the Red Sea diversions, and the threat of a strike.</p><p>Michael Aldwell, executive vice president for <span class=\"QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer\" data-test=\"QuoteInBody\" id=\"SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-5\">Kuehne + Nagel<span class=\"QuoteInBody-inlineButton\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer\" id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\" data-analytics-id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\"><button class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton\" aria-label=\"Add To Watchlist\" data-testid=\"dropdown-btn\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag\"></span></button></span></span></span>, says it is tracking a double-digit shift in cargo moving away from the East Coast and advising clients to have an established method of getting cargo into the U.S. in advance of a labor crisis.</p><p>“As a result of these uncertainties, our customers are telling us they need options, and they need options before it’s a necessity to try and grab capacity,” said Aldwell. “So we’re counseling our customers, take the opportunity while there’s no congestion, while there’s no risk. And it is playing out already. Move some of your cargo so you establish a transload supply chain via the West Coast,” which ultimately travels back by truck and rail to the East Coast and Gulf Coast.</p><p>Other logistics companies confirmed the trend.</p><p>“We are seeing a significant change back to the U.S. West Coast,” said Paul Brashier, vice president of drayage and intermodal for ITS Logistics. “I would say 25% of our client’s freight is coming back to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.”</p><p>The movement of trade away from the East Coast influences the volume of freight moving on the rails, with the extra containers a tailwind for Union Pacific and BNSF, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, which previously saw a decrease in containers being moved.</p><p>Beth Whited, president of <span class=\"QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer\" data-test=\"QuoteInBody\" id=\"SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-6\">Union Pacific<span class=\"QuoteInBody-inlineButton\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer\" id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\" data-analytics-id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\"><button class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton\" aria-label=\"Add To Watchlist\" data-testid=\"dropdown-btn\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag\"></span></button></span></span></span>, said she thinks that the labor negotiations with the ILA could push freight back to the West Coast, and the Panama Canal could cause some trade to come out of the Gulf and be pushed back to the West Coast.</p><p>“Right now that is just fractional,” said Whited. “But as the shipping community continues to make decisions about where they want their freight to land for their comfort and certainty of supply, we’ll see how that works out ... we’re going to be ready to handle it if that’s what happens.”</p><p>Mario Cordero, executive director of the Port of Long Beach, which recently reported its fifth consecutive month of freight volume increase, tells CNBC it is forecasting the annual volume trend to at least match and likely exceed the pre-Covid 2019 number of 6.3 million twenty-foot equivalent (TEU) container units.</p><p>“We are forecasting an escalation by the end of the year,” said Cordero. “Just to put it into context, we moved 8.1 million [TEUs] last year. This year we believe we might get up to 8.4 million.”</p><h3 class=\"ArticleBody-smallSubtitle\">Preparing for labor strife, but a history of strikes averted</h3><p>Charles Van der Steene, president of Maersk North America, told CNBC on the sidelines of the recent TPM Conference in California — where shippers and ocean carriers met and discussed their contracts — that all of this is factoring into peak contract negotiation season with customers.</p><p>“We see on an ongoing basis the question emerging as to what level should we be ready to potentially make decisions for different inland locations, for different routing of our cargo,” said Van der Steene. “And how do we then prepare for that as part of the contract? So it’s a part of the discussion, but at this stage, it’s again not dissimilar from the same preparations that were had for the negotiations on the West Coast.”</p><p>One of the strategies being suggested by logistics experts for their East Coast freight customers is to bring in containers for peak shipping season early, starting in June versus July.</p><p>“We’re certainly having a lot of conversations with customers right now to make those decisions early, to, to maybe pull in a little more stock earlier in the summer,” said Tim Robertson, CEO of DHL Global Forwarding Americas. “So you’re not caught up in any potential disruption, and to get access to some of the West Coast routing. These are the discussions that we’re having, right now, and I fully expect you’re going to see many shippers start to move that way, I would say, in the coming months.”</p><p>Lars Ostergaard, head of Americas liner operations at Maersk, says it is planning ahead itself and keeping a close eye on the negotiations.</p><p>“As of now, we’re advising people to continue using the East Coast, said Ostergaard. “There could be issues when you get beyond October 1, but obviously no one at this point in time knows if that’s the case. So what we are advising our clients to do is to think about potentially, if possible, to pre-move some cargo, particularly because you come into the holiday season at the back of the year, and that it would make sense to think about,” he said. “Are there certain items that are critical for that season that perhaps, if possible, you should actually try and move before the end of September if possible?”</p><p>Ostergaard said customers are generally thinking about supply chains in a very different way than they did pre-pandemic, and are concerned about delays.</p><p>Mike Hatfield, senior manager of global logistics for Berlin Packing, which imports glass bottles, said the lessons learned during Covid enabled the company to quickly mitigate risk of a strike or slowdown.</p><p>“We learned we are not tied down to just going to the West Coast, East Coast, and support volume to other ports in the event the East Coast shuts down,” said Hatfield. “We know we can go back into the West Coast rail product, truck product cross country, so it’s just making sure that we have diversity within our supply chain, within our partners, within our contracts for multiple routings of similar lanes. A little bit of redundancy can go a long way.”</p><p>D’Andrae Larry, head of intermodal for <span class=\"QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer\" data-test=\"QuoteInBody\" id=\"SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-7\">Uber<span class=\"QuoteInBody-inlineButton\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer\" id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\" data-analytics-id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\"><button class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton\" aria-label=\"Add To Watchlist\" data-testid=\"dropdown-btn\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag\"></span></button></span></span></span> Freight, tells CNBC that more customers are coming to him saying they want to plan for the “what if.”</p><p>“We’ve learned that optionality is the order of tomorrow,” he said.</p><p>Cargo owners at TPM indicated a need for more data and the ability to start plugging that into predictive analytics, according to Chris Rogers, head of supply chain for S&amp;P Global.</p><p>“We know what a disrupted system looks like,” said Rogers. “We’ve seen behaviorally what happened during the pandemic and how the ports kind of hit capacity, particularly here on the West Coast. I think one of the other challenges with the labor situation is we’re also running into the elections. And so this whole thing around labor becoming very politicized.”</p><p>That’s a global phenomenon, Rogers said. “We are also seeing protests in lots of different countries linked to politics that have an impact on logistics networks. Fingers crossed, cooler minds will prevail and we’ll get a solution well ahead of time. It’s in no one’s interest to disrupt shipping during peak season, but we’ve got a little way to go before we get there,” he added.</p><p>So far, labor talks are progressing at the local level, says Daniel Walsh, CEO of TRAC Intermodal, North America’s leading marine chassis pool manager and equipment provider, and the parties are talking.</p><p>“I think that if you look at the history, there seems to be a shared understanding that a strike is not really in anyone’s interest, and it’s best to avoid that if possible,” said Walsh. “They’re working pretty, pretty aggressively towards that sort of a conclusion. Hopefully, they can be able to manage it.”</p><p>Lars Jensen, CEO of Vespucci Maritime, said he is hopeful that history will repeat itself in this case. ILA negotiations in the past have not led to many major disruptions and he anticipates no major changes to the normal pattern of West Coast trade. “The risk [of a strike] is, of course, always there. But historically there has been more success in those negotiations than what you’ve seen with the ILWU on the West Coast.&nbsp;Peak season might start slightly earlier. Again, people might be concerned about the stability of the supply chains,” he said.</p>',	'2024-03-07 21:30:13.501',	NULL,	'US',	'Strikes at East Coast, Gulf ports are a big labor risk this year, and trade diversions have already started',	'https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107227028-1681828414571-gettyimages-1247247361-AA_18022023_1072021.jpeg?v=1709833924&w=929&h=523&vtcrop=y'),

Of course,&nbsp;the attitude cannot change fundamentally in one day, or even a year, it is a long process,” she said.</p><p>Bilozerska has been able to see that process take place, having first joined a volunteer battalion in 2014 when Russian proxies were advancing in Ukraine’s east.</p><p>She became prominent in the movement calling for women to be able to take up combat roles in Ukraine’s armed forces, a move that came into force in 2016 and to have their previous service recognized. Bilozeska became an officer in 2018 and was then the commander of an artillery platoon for two years in&nbsp;Donetsk before “retiring” in 2020.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>A week before Russia invaded on Feb. 24, 2022, she said she, her husband and other “brothers in arms” signed up at a military unit in anticipation of the invasion.</p><p>Since 2022, she has returned to her role as a sniper and has achieved a legendary status in Ukraine for her abilities and courage, so much so that Russia has tried to spread fake news about her “elimination.” It’s something she’s positive about, however, saying it means the Russians haven’t forgotten about her: “That means they are afraid,” she says.</p><p>Nonetheless, Bilozerska has her own experience of discrimination among her peers, noting “every woman in the military has her own story, even several, about how she was not allowed somewhere because she was a woman, or that somebody was allowed to make offensive remarks.”</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Bilozerska recalled one of her own experiences when she was in a truck with eight other male colleagues, including a commander. The truck got stuck in Ukraine’s infamous mud and the men got out to push the vehicle.</p><p>“I didn’t go as I considered it unnecessary because there were more than enough men and I wouldn’t even have a place near that truck (although when there were only three of us in a similar situation, then I pushed together with the men). The guys quickly pushed the truck out, turned back, and the commander tells me: ‘That’s why I’m against women being accepted into the army. Because we have nine fighters on paper, but only eight in reality’,” she said.</p><p>“Of course, the longer the war lasts, the more women are on the front lines, the better the treatment becomes,” Bilozerska noted, “although there are still military men who are convinced that if there are no girls at the front lines in their unit, then there are no girls at the front lines at all.”</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeatedly praises the efforts of the country’s female defenders; last International Woman’s Day thanking “all the women who work, teach, study, rescue, heal, fight — fight for Ukraine.” Ukraine’s defense ministry is also keen to highlight efforts it has made to level the playing field for female recruits.</p><p>Last October, it said it had&nbsp;“canceled all restrictions on the access of servicewomen to all positions” in the army, noting that “earlier, women could serve mainly in positions of medical specialties, communications workers, accountants, clerks and cooks. Now,&nbsp;a woman in the army can be a driver, grenade launcher, deputy commander of a reconnaissance group, commander of BMP [a Soviet-era infantry fighting vehicle], repairman, machine gunner, sniper,&nbsp;etc,” the ministry said on Telegram.</p><p>Previously, a contract for military service was signed by women aged 18 to 40, while men did not face the same restriction.&nbsp;“Now, from 18 to 60 years of age, representatives of both sexes can become contractors,” the ministry noted.</p><p>It’s a far cry from 2021 when Ukrainian female troops were photographed practising for a parade wearing&nbsp;high heels with onlookers calling the policy sexist and idiotic.</p><p>While positive changes are being made to encourage equality in the forces, there is still some way to go with reports of sexual harassment as well as discrimination, although the ministry has vowed to root “unacceptable” behavior out.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>One area of progress has been propeled by women, for women, and that’s in the area of uniforms, protective gear and essential supplies. Kseniia Drahaniuk was a blogger before the war but she now runs a not-for-profit that has developed and made properly-sized army clothing and equipment for women.</p><p>″[Before] women improvised various solutions, sewing their own uniforms with local tailors, altering men’s clothing to fit, or using belts for adjustments. However, dealing with these challenges during full-scale war significantly impacted their service productivity. These were not tasks military servicewomen should have been burdened with,” she told CNBC.</p><p>She says her organization, Zemlyachky, has now fulfilled 15,000 individual requests for uniforms, body armor, helmets, properly-sized footwear, undergarments, and other necessities. It has also provided psychological support and rehabilitation to female soldiers. For some, it has even offered free weddings as soldiers try to continue to have a “normal life.”</p><p>For many, war has forced a complete change of identity with former lives barely recognizable to their service on the frontline now. Yuliia, who preferred not to give her last name for security reasons, was a model before the war but volunteered soon after Russia’s invasion and is now serving as a paramedic in an assault regiment in the war’s hotspot, Donetsk.</p><p>Yuliia, whose call sign in “Diia” or “Action” (call signs are used to quickly identify colleagues and speed up communication in the army) is part of a medical crew evacuating wounded fighters, civilians and even animals. “I also meet the bodies of fallen soldiers, this is the most difficult line of work,” she told CNBC over email.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>On the frontlines now in a region experiencing extreme destruction and attritional battles with hundreds of troops estimated to be dying on both sides, on a daily basis, Yuliaa’s life and work now couldn’t be further from her previous life when she worked as a model.</p><p>On the catwalk, “a lot depends on you, but definitely not someone’s life,” she said, noting that now she sees photos or videos on social networks that were taken before the war and thinks “I don’t realize that it was in my life.”</p><p>Yuliia can’t imagine what life will be like after the war, saying the prospect of peace “seems something distant and even strange” and says she regrets the time that has been lost with loved ones.</p><p>“I do not regret my choice. Both before and now, I am sure that if I can help at least one of our soldiers, all of this is not in vain,” she says. “At the moment, there is not one but dozens of them and it is scary.”</p>',	'2024-03-08 16:30:16.050',	NULL,	'US',	'Ukraine’s female soldiers are fighting on two fronts — against Russians, and sexism within their ranks',	'https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107383814-1709804947241-gettyimages-1533129222-AA_15072023_1273973.jpeg?v=1709804999&w=929&h=523&vtcrop=y'),

(207,	'',	'Biden says he’ll ban TikTok if Congress passes bill, but he’s campaigning on it until then',	'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>When Joe Biden joined TikTok on the eve of the Super Bowl last month, political scientist Maggie Macdonald was struck by what she called the “meta” nature of the president’s first post.</p><p>In the video, Biden poked fun at a conspiracy theory that he rigged the Super Bowl — in favor of the Kansas City Chiefs — to somehow help his reelection efforts. </p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>“Yeah, I’m old, but I’m on TikTok, and I’m on this super online place talking about this super online concept,” Macdonald, an assistant political science professor at the University of Kentucky, said of the messaging and tone of Biden’s video.</p><p>While Biden’s debut on the wildly popular social media app came in a playful manner, his use of TikTok in this year’s reelection campaign is at the heart of a heated debate in Washington, D.C., about whether the service should even exist in the U.S. The app, owned by China’s ByteDance, is viewed as both an invaluable tool in trying to reach masses of young potential voters who are unplugged from mainstream media and an easy way, allegedly, for the Chinese government to spy on American consumers. </p><p>Members of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party introduced a bill this week that would require ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a U.S. ban, following earlier federal and state-led efforts that never came to fruition. On Thursday, the committee voted 50-0 to send the bill to the House floor. &nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after the committee advanced the bill, Rep. Troy Balderson, R-Ohio, called TikTok “a surveillance tool used by the Chinese Communist Party to spy on Americans and harvest highly personal data.” </p><p>TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has denied in Senate hearings any ties between the app and the CCP. In a statement to CNBC on Thursday, TikTok said, “The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression,” an act that “will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience, and destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country.”</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Since Biden’s playful intro post, his campaign’s TikTok account has notched over 222,000 followers and over 2.4 million likes. With eight months until the general election and a likely rematch of the 2020 contest, Biden narrowly trails Republican challenger Donald Trump in most national polls in what’s expected to be a tight battle to the end. </p><p>Biden’s age has shown up as a persistent concern in polling data, so experts say reaching out to younger audiences is key in trying to win over undecided young voters, and mobilize a traditional Democratic constituency whose members sometimes stay home on Election Day.</p><p>“It’s really important for him to have a presence, and for him to interact directly with voters, not just through creators and influencers,” said Aaron Earls, CEO of social media influencer firm Activate HQ, which specializes in political campaigns. “The turnout in 2020 was really significant with that younger audience and, everyone’s suggesting that maybe there will be a similar turnout with the younger audience again.”</p><p>During the State of the Union address Thursday evening, Biden’s campaign posted clips of the speech on TikTok, a sign that the president plans to stick with the app despite swirling concerns in Washington. But it’s a particularly convoluted matter for Biden because, should the bill pass the full House and the Senate, it would hit the president’s desk. </p><p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday that, “This bill is important, we welcome this step.” She said the administration plans to “meet the American people where they are,” adding that, “It doesn’t mean that we’re not going to try to figure out how to protect our national security.”</p><p>Biden said on Friday that he will sign the bill if Congress passes it. </p><p>The Biden campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>TikTok is trying to generate support from users following the House’s action on Thursday. On the app, users were greeted with a screenshot warning them that Congress was “planning a total ban of TikTok.” Multiple staffers and lawmakers told CNBC their offices were flooded with calls, mostly from kids.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>U.S. political campaigns more broadly are trying to figure out how best to utilize TikTok.</p><p>In recent cycles, Facebook has been the social media app of choice for campaigns because of its ability to narrowly target users with fundraising ads and informational posts. However, <span class=\"QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer\" data-test=\"QuoteInBody\" id=\"RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-11\">Apple’s<span class=\"QuoteInBody-inlineButton\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer\" id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\" data-analytics-id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\"><button class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton\" aria-label=\"Add To Watchlist\" data-testid=\"dropdown-btn\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag\"></span></button></span></span></span> 2021 iOS privacy update made it much harder to target audiences, raising the cost of ad campaigns across <span class=\"QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer\" data-test=\"QuoteInBody\" id=\"RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-12\">Meta’s<span class=\"QuoteInBody-inlineButton\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer\" id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\" data-analytics-id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\"><button class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton\" aria-label=\"Add To Watchlist\" data-testid=\"dropdown-btn\"><span class=\"AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag\"></span></button></span></span></span> platforms.</p><p>Additionally, Facebook has skewed older over the years, with younger groups gravitating to TikTok. The challenge for campaigns is that TikTok says it doesn’t allow for political ads or “content such as a video from a politician asking for donations, or a political party directing people to a donation page on their website.” </p><p>To date, major campaigns have relied on high-profile TikTok influencers to help rally support for specific issues. Last April, for instance, the White House said it was enlisting a squad of volunteer TikTok and Instagram influencers to help spread awareness of the Biden campaign.</p><p>Earls says it’s a strategy that’s long been employed in politics. TikTok just presents a new medium.</p><p>“That has historically been a tactic that’s happened since the Kennedy days, but just more in traditional media,” Earls said. “Like you’re going to get an endorsement from Marilyn Monroe or Joe DiMaggio or whatever.” </p><p>Political groups are scouring TikTok for influencers with positions that resonate with would-be voters, and are targeting certain swing states that could be critical in deciding an election. During the 2022 midterm elections, the Democratic National Committee and communications groups like Climate Power enlisted the help of TikTok and influencers to discuss issues like abortion rights and to mobilize voters.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Even with its growing popularity, TikTok remains a niche tool in politics. </p><p>Anupam Chander, a Georgetown University Law Center professor, released a study with some colleagues last year showing that fewer than 10% of members of the U.S. Congress have a “TikTok account from which they post content,” most likely because of the app’s connection to China. In total, the report said, 34 House members and seven senators had an official TikTok account.</p><p>Among major politicians using TikTok, an overwhelming majority are Democrats, the study showed. Some of Republicans’ resistance could tie back to Trump’s vow — which was ultimately unsuccessful — to ban TikTok during his administration. </p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>One of the few high-profile Republicans now on the app is former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who said during a primary debate that “part of how we win elections is reaching the next generation of young Americans where they are.”</p><p>As to whether Trump will use TikTok in his campaign, Earls said he wouldn’t be surprised to see it. The decision, he said, likely has less to do with China and is more about Trump’s connection to his own social media platform, Truth Social, where he posts with frequency. </p><p>“We’ve seen him do whatever it takes to win an election including trying to stop the peaceful transition of power,” Earls said. “He will do what he thinks will help him win so I suspect we’ll see his campaign join TikTok in the coming months depending upon how things develop with his ability to&nbsp;monetize Truth Social.”</p><p>The Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Anish Mohanty, communications director for Gen-Z for Change, said his nonprofit advocacy group was originally called TikTok for Biden when it formed in 2020 as part of an effort “to defeat Donald Trump.” The group changed its name the following year, and now taps its network of hundreds of TikTok social media influencers to advocate for multiple progressive issues related to climate change, universal health care and for Biden to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.</p><p>Given the many challenges Biden faces with younger groups, his mere presence on TikTok isn’t enough to win votes, Mohanty said, particularly if the president’s campaign is “just using it to post cringy memes about Trump.” </p><p>“Young people care about issues, that’s why young people are so unhappy with Biden over action on climate change, over the situation in Gaza,” Mohanty said. “Just because Biden is posting on TikTok, that’s not what’s going to pull young people over.”</p><p>Still, Macdonald sees a big opportunity for Biden.</p><p>“If you want to reach younger people who are very apathetic, they’re on TikTok,” said the University of Kentucky professor. “You have an incentive to reach them on TikTok, and it does seem that the Republican Party as a unit is just not doing it.”</p><p><strong>WATCH</strong>: Denying a platform isn’t denying free speech.</p>',	'2024-03-09 10:00:27.438',	NULL,	'US',	'Biden says he’ll ban TikTok if Congress passes bill, but he’s campaigning on it until then',	'https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107273383-1689731601487-gettyimages-1534871843-arriens-tiktokap230714_npFdy.jpeg?v=1709931420&w=929&h=523&vtcrop=y'),

But in lower-tier cities, such as Chengdu, Yum China is seeing stronger sales growth because housing is cheaper and consumers have more cash to spend. </p><p>Cities in China are often classified into tiers based on factors such as population and gross domestic product, although there’s no official ranking system.</p><p>“We have a really good business model, not only in a top-tier city, but all the way to the tier five, tier six city,” Wat said.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The overwhelming majority of Yum China’s current footprint is made up of KFC locations, but the company also runs Pizza Hut restaurants and Lavazza coffee shops.

Both of those cases led to, or involved, war.</p><p>Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War noted in analysis last week that the appeal by Transnistria likely aimed “to provide the Kremlin with justifications for a wide range of possible escalatory actions against Moldova — actions the Kremlin can pursue both immediately and over the long-term.”</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>“The Kremlin can use the outcomes of the Congress of Transnistrian Deputies to justify a range of possible courses of action that are not mutually exclusive.&nbsp;The most likely course of action is that the Kremlin will use the Congress as a springboard to intensify hybrid operations aimed a destabilizing and further polarizing Moldova ahead of Moldova-European Union accession negotiations and the upcoming Moldovan presidential election in June and November 2024, respectively,” the ISW said. </p><p>“The most dangerous course of action is that the Kremlin may decide to formally annex Transnistria in the future in order to justify military intervention against Moldova in the long-term,” it noted.</p>',	'2024-03-05 12:23:40.779',	NULL,	'US',	'Russia can’t reach a pro-Russian region in Moldova easily — but there are ways it can cause trouble',	'https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105073443-649266338.jpg?v=1699588698&w=929&h=523&vtcrop=y'),

Target also said it took a hit in recent quarters from elevated levels of theft and the fallout from backlash to Target’s merchandise collection for Pride Month.</p><p>To attract shoppers, the big-box retailer has emphasized value and more frequently bought categories, such as food and beauty. Over the holiday season, for example, Target touted a wide assortment of gifts and a holiday meal for four for under $25.&nbsp;</p><p>Last month, it launched a new low-priced private brand called Dealworthy, with products like socks, paper towels, laundry detergent and more. Most items cost under $10.</p><p>Target’s profits have suffered along with its sales. But the retailer made more money in the fourth quarter than it did a year ago, as it marked down fewer items and had more products in stock.&nbsp;</p><p>Target’s net income for the three-month period rose by nearly 58% to $1.38 billion, or $2.98 per share, from $876 million, or $1.89 per share in the year-ago quarter. That was significantly higher than Target’s forecasted range of between $1.90 and $2.60 per share.</p><p>Its margins also were healthier compared with a year ago. Its fourth quarter operating income margin rate was 5.8% compared with 3.7% in the year-ago quarter, a time when Target’s results took a hit as customers bought fewer higher-margin items like clothing, and more of lower-margin ones, such as food and household essentials.</p><p>In the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Feb. 3, Target’s total revenue grew nearly 2% from $30.98 billion in the year-ago period. Those results got a boost from an additional week of sales compared to fiscal 2022.</p><p>Comparable sales dropped in stores and online. Comparable store sales fell 5.4% year over year. Digital sales declined 0.7% year over year, marking an improvement from the 6% drop in the third quarter.</p><p>The sequential improvement in traffic trends – from a 4.1% decline in the third quarter to a 1.7% decline in the fourth quarter – was fueled by more shoppers using curbside pickup.&nbsp;</p><p>As of Monday’s close, Target’s shares are up nearly 6% so far this year. That falls short of the approximately 8% gains of the S&amp;P 500 during the same period. Target’s shares closed on Monday at $150.49, bringing the company’s market value to $69.48 billion.</p><p><em><strong>This is breaking news.

Raja suggested the finance minister will err on the side of caution in loosening fiscal policy, favoring supply side support over boosting demand.</p><p>“Supply side measures are more likely in our view, particularly with the Bank of England more amenable to loosening monetary policy,” Raja said.</p><p>“Therefore, tax cuts to national insurance contributions (NICs) and changes to child benefits are more likely to come in the Spring Budget (in contrast to earlier expectations of income tax cuts).”</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>A substantial cut to National Insurance was the highlight of Hunt’s Autumn Statement, though economists were quick to point out that its benefit to payers would be more than erased by the effect of existing freezes on personal income tax thresholds — known as the “fiscal drag.”</p><p>The U.K. National Insurance is a tax on workers’ income and employers’ profits to pay for state social security benefits, including the state pension.</p><p>Raja also suggested an extension of the government’s existing freeze on fuel duty remains a possibility, and that some spending cuts will likely be used to partially offset a loosening of fiscal policy.</p><p>In total, Deutsche Bank expects Hunt to deliver net loosening of £15 billion over the coming fiscal year, dropping to around £12.5 billion in the medium-term.</p><p>“The outlook for the public finances remains precarious. Slight changes to the macroeconomic outlook could result in big shifts to the public finances. The Chancellor continues to walk a fine line between managing his fiscal rules now and rising austerity later,” Raja said.</p><p>“To be sure, big questions on the public finances remain – including whether spending cuts, or limited rises in some areas, remain realistic to tackle the rising strain in public services, and the Government’s own ambitions around net-zero, defence, and overseas development spending.”</p><p>BNP Paribas economists expect a more modest package of tax cuts worth around £10 billion across the 2024/25 fiscal year, and projected that the government will start the year with a fiscal windfall of around £11 billion.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The French bank agreed that the reductions will be aimed at stimulating labor supply, with “little impact on inflation and thus the Bank of England.”</p><p>“Our base case is that the government will spend GBP10bn of the near-term fiscal windfall and use the additional medium-term fiscal space to cut personal taxes,” economists Matthew Swannell and Dani Stoilova said in a research note entitled “last-chance saloon.”</p><p>They also expect the Treasury to postpone the March 2024 rise in fuel duty for another 12 months, at a cost of £3.7 billion a year, and to introduce a permanent 1 pence reduction in the basic rate of income tax at a cost of between £6 billion and £7.35 billion per year.</p><p>“The overall effect of this policy package would be to leave medium-term fiscal headroom roughly back where it started at GBP12.7bn,” they added.</p><p>“With the Conservative party trailing in the opinion polls and the Budget possibly the last opportunity to loosen fiscal policy before a general election, we expect Chancellor Hunt to once again, at least, spend any additional fiscal space available to him.”</p>',	'2024-03-05 12:23:40.799',	NULL,	'US',	'‘Last chance saloon’: UK finance minister expected to pledge pre-election tax cuts',	'https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107209017-16788828292023-03-15t105112z_266524623_rc2auz9abwy4_rtrmadp_0_britain-budget.jpeg?v=1680247722&w=929&h=523&vtcrop=y'),

He said it is “perfectly reasonable” to&nbsp;expect the Nikkei to rise to 55,000 before the end of 2025.</p><p>“Go-go Nikkei,” he quipped, making a pun on the Japanese translation of 5-5 being “go-go.”</p><p>He said Japanese CEOs are the “undisputed global champions of&nbsp;delivering&nbsp;on the hard part, true economic value creation.”</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Veteran value investor Warren Buffett increased his stakes in five of Japan’s largest trading houses in 2023, but promised the CEO of each company that Berkshire Hathaway “would never buy more than 9.9% without their consent.”</p><p>“They all welcomed us in, and their results have exceeded our expectations since we purchased the group,” he told CNBC in April last year.</p><p>“We couldn’t feel better about the investment [in Japan],” he added, after speaking to the CEOs of those trading houses, namely Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo.</p><p>According to Koll, the real question investors have to ask now is: What is the probability&nbsp;for Japanese profits and EPS&nbsp;to rise by&nbsp;37% between now and end-2025?</p><p>He said that most foreign investors he spoke to think an EPS growth of about 30-40% is a “perfectly reasonable forecast.” He pointed out that after all, EPS surged 11 times between 1995 to 2002, during a time when Japan was experiencing deflation.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Still, there are may be global and domestic risks that could derail that optimism.</p><p>At home, Koll said Kishida is aiming to boost government spending, including raising child-care allowances and increased spending on deep tech university research and defense — but the prime minister has yet to present plans on how to pay for these initiatives.</p><p>As such, Koll is expecting tax hikes to be on the horizon, perhaps in 2025 or 2026.

The key metric, which includes digital sales and takes out the impact of store openings, closures and renovations, fell 4.4% in the fiscal fourth quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>Target doesn’t anticipate sales will bounce back quickly. For the current quarter, the company said it expects comparable sales to drop by between 3% and 5% and adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.70 to $2.10. Target said it expects full-year 2024 comparable sales to be flat to up 2% and adjusted earnings per share to range from $8.60 to $9.60.</p><p>Yet Target stressed its progress after a rough stretch marked by lower discretionary spending. Store and website traffic, while still down year over year, improved for the second quarter in a row. Profits jumped as the company better managed inventory and benefited from falling supply chain, freight and e-commerce fulfillment costs. And an emphasis on lower price points resonated with shoppers.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview Tuesday with CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” CEO Brian Cornell said the company has made “really solid progress”<strong> </strong>in managing inventory better and becoming more efficient. He said the retailer will focus on “growing traffic and making sure that we make Target a growth company again.”</p><p>Those new sales drivers for the year ahead will include a membership program, he said. Cornell declined to share more details to CNBC, but said “it’s going to be a really important part of what drives growth for us as we go into next year.” He added that the company plans to emphasize same-day delivery to the home, so that customers can get groceries or other items within two hours. Target already owns Shipt, a membership-based delivery service.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>Company leaders will share more of their strategy at an investor meeting in New York City on Tuesday.</p><p>Here’s what the retailer reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:</p><ul><li>Earnings per share: $2.98 vs. $2.42 expected</li><li>Revenue: $31.92 billion vs. $31.83 billion expected</li></ul><p>Target’s sluggish sales have reflected a pullback in discretionary spending over the past two years, especially after huge pandemic-driven gains. Its annual total revenue grew by about $31 billion – or nearly 40% – from fiscal 2019 to 2022 before sales leveled out. Target also said it took a hit in recent quarters from elevated levels of theft and the fallout from backlash to Target’s merchandise collection for Pride month.</p><p>To attract shoppers, the big-box retailer has emphasized value and more frequently bought categories, such as food and beauty. Over the holiday season, for example, Target touted a wide assortment of gifts and a holiday meal for four for under $25.&nbsp;</p><p>Last month, it launched a new low-priced private brand called Dealworthy, with products like socks, paper towels, laundry detergent and more. Most items cost under $10.</p><p>Target’s profits have suffered along with its sales. But the retailer made more money in the fourth quarter than it did a year ago, as it marked down fewer items and had more products in stock.&nbsp;</p><p>Target’s net income for the three-month period rose by nearly 58% to $1.38 billion, or $2.98 per share, from $876 million, or $1.89 per share in the year-ago quarter. That was significantly higher than Target’s forecast range of between $1.90 and $2.60 per share.</p><p>Its margins also were healthier compared with a year ago. Its fourth-quarter operating income margin rate was 5.8% compared with 3.7% in the year-ago quarter, a time when Target’s results took a hit as customers bought fewer higher-margin items like clothing, and more of lower-margin ones, such as food and household essentials.</p><p>In the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Feb. 3, Target’s total revenue grew nearly 2% from $31.40 billion in the year-ago period. Those results got a boost from an additional week of sales compared with fiscal 2022.</p><p>Comparable sales dropped in stores and online. Comparable store sales fell 5.4% year over year. Digital sales declined 0.7% year over year, marking an improvement from the 6% drop in the third quarter.</p><p>The sequential improvement in traffic trends – from a 4.1% decline in the third quarter to a 1.7% decline in the fourth quarter – was fueled by more shoppers using curbside pickup.&nbsp;</p><p>As of Monday’s close, Target’s shares are up nearly 6% so far this year. That falls short of the approximately 8% gains of the S&amp;P 500 during the same period. Target’s shares closed Monday at $150.49, bringing the company’s market value to $69.48 billion.</p><p><em>Correction: In the fiscal fourth quarter, Target’s total revenue grew nearly 2% from $31.40 billion in the year-ago period.

What investors are expecting',	'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell heads to Capitol Hill Wednesday with markets intent on getting more clarity about how the central bank plans on proceeding with monetary policy this year.</p><p>The past several months have seen a changing dynamic between financial markets and the Fed over the pace and timing of expected interest rate cuts this year. Markets have had to adjust their collective view from a highly accommodative central bank to one that’s more cautious and deliberate.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>With his congressionally mandated testimony coming before the House on Wednesday and the Senate on Thursday, Powell will be tasked with providing a sharper view — and not rocking the boat for a nervous Wall Street.</p><p>“The question now for the market is to glean any information on when when the Fed will begin employing rate cuts and how many,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. “He’s not going to answer that necessarily. But if there is any change, any nuance, that is what the market wants to see.”</p><p>Central to the question of how the Fed acts from here out is its view on inflation and how Powell expresses that. In recent weeks, he and others have expressed satisfaction with the trend in prices along with apprehension that risks still lurk, saying it’s too early to ease up on monetary policy.</p><p>Markets currently anticipate the Fed will begin cutting in June and enact the equivalent of four quarter-percentage point cuts in total this year, according to futures market pricing gauged by the CME Group. Policymakers in December indicated three cuts and mostly have avoided providing a timetable.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>On the inflation issue, the data had been cooperating for the most part.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>Inflation readings in the latter part of 2023 showed a clear trend towards the Fed’s 2% target. However, January brought a jolt, showing that consumer prices, particularly in shelter costs, remained stubbornly higher and posed a threat to the trend.</p><p>Powell will have to synthesize the recent trends carefully as he speaks first to the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, then the Senate Banking Committee the day after.</p><p>“The message very much is not going to be ‘mission accomplished,’ but ‘we’ve made a lot of progress, we anticipate rate cuts are coming,’” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. “That to me is what I think will be the central message.”</p><p>Powell’s testimony before Congress comes at a ticklish time for markets: After breaching historic highs, major stock averages have sold off this week amid ongoing concern about where rates are headed and a suddenly uncertain outlook for a few of the Big Tech names that have been driving prices higher.</p><p>Both conditions are concerning for policymakers. Big jumps in risk asset prices could reflect loose financial conditions that might cause the Fed to hold tight on policy, while a less certain environment could raise fears about staying too high for too long on rates.</p><p>Powell “cannot deviate at all from the ‘data-dependent, but we really want to cut rates’ approach the Committee has committed to,” wrote Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities. “Sharp swings in financial conditions can easily work at cross-purposes to the Committee’s objective: maintaining tight labor market conditions while also keeping inflation expectations and long-term rates well anchored,” he said, referring to the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>There are also other dynamics facing Powell: A number of economists, including LaVorgna, see labor conditions weakening despite the apparent strength of a 3.7% unemployment rate. Also, a stunning run-up in cryptocurrency prices recently suggests untethered risk-taking that could indicate too much liquidity washing around the system.</p><p>Indeed, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic on Monday released an essay in which he expressed concern about potential “pent-up exuberance” that could be unleashed after rate cuts start.</p><p>“We don’t think monetary policy itself is loose, but the Fed and Powell have to wonder about this nonetheless, in view of these extant ‘remnants’ of speculation,” strategists at Macquarie said in a client note Tuesday. “The point is that small speculative frenzies that come out of nowhere should make it even more difficult for the Fed to sound dovish at this juncture.”</p><p>Finally, there are political considerations.</p><p>Along with the usual pressure that comes during presidential election years, there have been calls on the Hill for Powell and his cohorts to start cutting rates. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), no fan of Powell to start with, called in January for the Fed to start cutting as higher rates are especially painful for lower-income households.</p><p>They’ll get a chance to hash out the issue Thursday as Warren is a member of the Senate banking panel.</p><p>Powell needs to make “a case for why the Fed needs to address rates in anticipation of where inflation is likely to be not where it is at the moment,” LaVorgna said. “You’re going to be damned if you do, damned if you don’t. So, I think you need a very solid framework.”</p>',	'2024-03-05 21:00:17.017',	NULL,	'US',	'Fed Chair Powell testifying to House on Wednesday.

First Solar is the largest manufacturer of solar panels in the U.S., focused on large, utility-scale projects.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>“All we want is to be able to compete on our own merits and to the extent there is dumping happening in the U.S. market, it should be addressed,” Widmar said. “Once it is addressed, we want it to be enforced.”</p><p>A common type of solar panel used in the U.S. is excluded from Section 201 tariffs designed to protect domestic solar manufacturing, and a moratorium on tariffs against solar components imported from several Southeast Asian nations is in place. While some industry stakeholders have supported these exemptions to help scale up solar power capacity in the U.S., Widmar said the carveouts are undermining the goals of the Inflation Reduction Act.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>“The intent of what we’re trying to do – to create this domestic industry that can enable long-term energy independence and security to achieve climate change goals and to enable cycles of innovation by having domestic capabilities – is all at risk,” Widmar said. “It’s unfortunate but that’s largely what’s happening.”</p><p>The Biden administration in 2022 extended Section 201 tariffs originally imposed by the Trump administration, but imported bifacial solar panels, which absorb light on both sides, are excluded from the duties. </p><p>In an investigation concluded last August, the U.S. Commerce Department found that some Chinese companies were skirting anti-dumping protections in the U.S. by shipping solar cells and modules through countries such as Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>But a decision by President Joe Biden in June 2022 to exempt those same Southeast Asian nations from solar tariffs for two years means penalties are not being enforced against some Chinese producers despite the Commerce Department’s conclusions.</p><p>Biden vetoed legislation last spring that would have imposed tariffs on solar components from Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand. In his veto message, the president described the exemption as a “temporary bridge” that is needed to help expand solar capacity in the U.S.</p><p>Though the exemption expires this June, Widmar said 30 to 40 gigawatts of excess product has made its way in to the U.S. market, which is equivalent to almost a full year of consumption.</p><p>“What this is doing is it’s not allowing these domestic companies to scale,” Widmar said.</p><p>The First Solar CEO said he is also worried that Chinese companies will exploit IRA tax credits, particularly the 7 cents per watt for solar modules, to set up assembly plants in the U.S. that do not move the ball forward in terms of technological innovation.</p><p>“What you’ve done is you’ve given the Chinese the opportunity to exploit the Inflation Reduction Act,” Widmar said.</p><p>A White House spokesperson wasn’t immediately available to comment. </p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>First Solar is largely insulated from the current market dynamics because the company is booked solid through at least 2026, Widmar said.

Sector-wise, high-tech related companies will continue to be promising,” Kazuo Momma, Mizuho Research Institute’s executive economist, told CNBC via email.</p><p>Japan’s corporate governance reforms have been a key driver for the country’s stock markets, Momma said, while stressing that stock indexes do not necessarily represent the entire economy that includes SMEs and households.</p><p>SMEs are a critical lever in the Japanese economy, accounting for 70% of national employment and 50% of the country’s economic growth.&nbsp;</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The rally in Japanese stocks has a disconnect with the country’s economy, which recently dipped into a technical recession and lost its spot as the world’s third-largest economy to Germany.</p><p>Soon after Japan entered a recession Nikkei hit 34-year highs, and the rally has been getting stronger with every passing day, despite bad news about the economy piling up.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><h3 class=\"ArticleBody-smallSubtitle\">External tailwinds</h3><p>Japan’s stocks have been turbo charged by the U.S. economy and a spike in Artificial intelligence-related companies including chip firms after U.S. chip designer Nvidia posted a 265% year on year rise in its revenue and closing above a $2 trillion market cap for the first time.</p><p>“Spillover from the global boom of AI-related stocks certainly helped Nikkei,” Momma said.&nbsp;The Information Technology sector accounts for 24.23% of the index, making it the largest component of the Nikkei.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Weaker yen, as well as investors looking to pare their exposure to China have also fueled the rally in Japan stocks.</p><p>“The depressed China’s economy and a shift of investors’ sentiment [away from] China also contributed to increasing foreign investors’ interest in Japanese stocks,” said Sayuri Shirai, professor at Keio University and former Bank of Japan board member.</p><h3 class=\"ArticleBody-smallSubtitle\">Why Nikkei rally may not last</h3><p>Japan Inc’s solid third-quarter earnings prompted Bank of America in February to upgrade their 2024 year-end forecasts for the Nikkei 225 to 41,000 from 38,500.&nbsp;</p><p>While the profit margin of firms in 2023 has improved significantly, partly owing to a series of successful price hikes, this could be just one-off development, said Momma.</p><p>He does not expect the Nikkei to continue its uptrend in a straight line going forward, with some corrections possible in the next few weeks or months.</p><p>“I would not be surprised if Nikkei goes down 36,000-37,000 levels at one point around mid-year,” he said, adding that even if that happens, the Nikkei would likely regain to 40,000 level by year-end.</p><p>Shirai said that foreign profits are heavily influenced by the dollar-yen rate, which lends a note of caution to the sustainability of the Nikkei’s blistering rally.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>“It is still too early to say this trend is sustainable. Domestic economy remains weak,” she said. “In Japan, there is no strong enthusiasm ... The economy is much weaker due to ageing and low productivity growth,” said Shirai.</p><p>Japan has been grappling with having the world’s oldest population, which poses an increasing strain on the country’s public finances.</p><p>Shirai added that given how Japan’s higher stock prices are in part driven by a robust U.S. economy, investors have to be cautious as declines are possible.</p><p>Also, should the yen strengthen towards 140 against the greenback, this “huge tailwind for earnings” will disappear, Amir Anvarzadeh, Japan equity market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors told CNBC.</p><p>“In fact, by Q2 of this year even if yen remains around where it is, much of the forex-related boost will fade,” he said, warning that the stocks multinationals and big exporters that have pushed the Nikkei higher will likely drop.</p><p>A recovery in China’s economy from current lows could also tip the balance towards money leaving Japan for China over the next quarter or so, said Anvarzadeh, who also warned of downside risk to the Nikkei.</p><p>Additionally, against the backdrop of a slew of weak economic data recently, which has been at odds with the rally in the Nikkei, experts have pointed out that the index does not reflect the state of the country’s economy.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Nikkei is a flawed stock market gauge given its price-weighted methodology,” said Phillip Colmar, Global Strategist and Managing Partner at research firm MRB Partners.</p><p>In price-weighted stock indexes, a company’s stock is weighted by its current price, as opposed to capitalization-weighted indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 where stocks are weighted based on their valuations.</p><p>“Equity markets are sentiment gauges and much more volatile than the underlying economy,” Colmar said, adding that Nikkei’s recent rise is not indicative of a dramatic improvement in Japan’s economic outlook, but of a reduced risk of chronic deflation.&nbsp;</p>',	'2024-03-05 23:30:21.174',	NULL,	'US',	'Will Nikkei’s record-breaking rally sustain even as Japan’s economy sputters?',	'https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107193992-1676344835151-gettyimages-1441083322-dsc_3581-edit.jpeg?v=1676418223&w=929&h=523&vtcrop=y'),

That’s because the Ivory Coast is estimated to account for about 44% of global supply, while Ghana holds a share of roughly 14% of output, he noted.</p><p>“Last year, heavier-than-usual rainfall raised concerns over the impact it would have on the crop, with rising cases of black pod disease. Heavy rains also led to issues over cocoa being delivered to ports,” Patterson said.</p><p>“This year, drier weather conditions and strong Harmattan winds are raising only further concerns over how the current crop evolves.”</p><p>El Niño-related dryness in much of Southeast Asia, India, Australia and parts of Africa has fueled a price rally for soft commodities such as cocoa, sugar and coffee in recent months.</p><p>The El Niño phenomenon is a naturally occurring climate pattern that takes place when sea temperatures in the eastern Pacific rise 0.5 degrees Celsius above the long-term average.

While the AI-driven bull run meets the first two criteria, Montgomery Koning said the third appears to be lacking.</p><p>“Liquidity is still ample, but leverage is not yet at worrying levels. QT has not resulted in shrinking liquidity in the US so far, as reverse repos (which absorb reserves) declined faster than the balance sheet. In fact, liquidity has been increasing somewhat since the start of last year (there is a risk that 2024 Fed cuts will add to the froth),” she said.</p><p>“But leverage doesn’t look worrying; margin debt and options open interest suggest that it’s not speculation driving the rally. There has been a small rise in margin debt but nowhere near the highs of 2020.”</p><h3 class=\"ArticleBody-smallSubtitle\">The bad news?</h3><p>The absence of a bubble does not necessarily imply that the market will continue to rise, UBS pointed out, with Baweja noting that productivity growth looks “nothing like it did in the 1990s.”</p><p>“Sure, this can change, but data today on electronics and info tech orders, capex intentions and actual capex doesn’t at all suggest the capital deepening associated with a productivity boost,” he said.</p><p>“Our metric of globalisation shows it is stalled (weakening, actually) compared to the late 1990s, when it grew the fastest. The economy is late cycle today.”</p><p>The current configuration of the economy is closest to that seen at the end of the 90s bull run and into early 2000, UBS believes, with real disposable income growth “weak and likely to get weaker. Baweja suggested that these variables need to start looking rosier in order for the bull run to persist sustainably.</p>',	'2024-03-07 15:30:14.755',	NULL,	'US',	'Stock market bubble?

The right-wing Israeli leader has also rejected Biden’s proposals of a leading role for the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority in Gaza’s future once the war ends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“These and other divisions are putting the entire ‘special relationship’ between the U.S. and Israel under pressure I have never seen before in my lifetime,” Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, told CNBC. “The relationship [between Biden and Netanyahu] is absolutely terrible.”</p><p>A report by Politico in early February cited unnamed Biden administration officials describing the president calling Netanyahu a “bad f—ng guy.” His spokespeople have denied it, saying that the leaders have “a decades-long relationship that is respectful in public and in private.”</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The reported rift appeared to worsen as Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz, a longtime rival of Netanyahu and considered to be more moderate, paid a visit to Washington this week at the invitation of the White House. According to a report by Axios, the visit “enraged” Netanyahu, “who ordered the Israeli embassy in Washington to not take any part in the visit or assist Gantz in any way.”</p><p>Gantz reportedly faced a barrage of harsh questions and critiques from the administration over Israel’s handling of the Gaza war.</p><p>CNBC has reached out to the White House and the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office for comment.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>As the U.S. General Election nears, promising a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump, Biden is facing a domestic challenge over his support for Israel’s war in Gaza, particularly from many young liberals and Muslim and Arab Americans.&nbsp;</p><p>This threatens to cost him crucial votes, particularly in swing states. Vice President Kamala Harris issued harsh comments in a speech on Sunday urging a cease-fire, saying “People in Gaza are starving. The conditions are inhumane.”</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>But Netanyahu is insistent that a cease-fire would threaten the Israeli Defense Force’s momentum, and that “total victory is within reach.” Some observers say his rhetoric is aimed at staying in power as his domestic approval rating sits at its lowest of his more than 16 years at the helm.</p><p>“It seems to me that Netanyahu is in a full campaign mode, and that presently, its main theme is resisting the emerging Biden strategy and the president himself,” Nimrod Novik, a fellow at the Israel Policy Forum, which is dedicated to advancing a two-state outcome to the conflict.</p><p>Particularly telling, Novik said, is “Netanyahu’s decision to preempt the emerging Biden strategy – which offers Israel a way out of Gaza, a hopeful change on the West Bank, as well as Saudi normalization and regional integration – by distorting this unprecedented offer and portraying it as an imposition.”</p><p>“The prime minister is focused on securing and energizing his ever-shrinking base,” he said of Netanyahu. “That base is as hard line as they come and responds best to nationalist machismo as in his promise to defend Israel from the imagined Biden imposition of a Palestinian state.”</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>“I’ve watched the [Biden] administration express its being fed up with the Netanyahu policy, from haggling over every truck of humanitarian assistance, through announcing West Bank triggering settlement expansion at such an explosive moment, to provocations on Temple Mount on the eve of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan,” Novik said.&nbsp;</p><p>But this is going largely ignored in the Israeli administration, he noted. “What might sound in Washington as a scream is hardly a whisper in Jerusalem.”</p><p>Ibish had similar observations.&nbsp;</p><p>“All the American support, especially from Biden personally, is being met with total ingratitude and actually with disdain,” from Netanyahu’s government, he said.&nbsp;</p><p>“If Biden were getting more cooperation from Netanyahu [and] the Israelis, he would not be pulling away from them, albeit carefully and subtly. This is, after all, an election year, and he will have to be very careful.”</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Yonatan Freeman, an international relations and media lecturer at Israel’s Hebrew University, believes the historically close relationship between the two countries will supersede the relationships between individual administrations and leaders.</p><p>“I think looking from a bird’s eye view we have to really focus on U.S.-Israel relations. And I don’t remember another war that Israel fought where it received so much support from a U.S. administration,” Freeman said. “Just as one example, the airlifting of U.S. military equipment to Israel occurred almost immediately …&nbsp; it never stopped.”&nbsp;</p><p>Still, he added, there is a broad perception among Israelis and many American Jews that former president Donald Trump was the most pro-Israel president in U.S. history.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think that this might be critical in some of the swing states where we have large Jewish and Israeli-American populations.” Roughly a quarter of Americans also identify as Evangelical Christian, a group that typically is very pro-Israel.&nbsp;</p><p>“So yes, this is something that could impact the elections,” Freeman said, adding that Biden’s hope of achieving normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia is also on hold for the time being.&nbsp;</p><p>“That would bring him great points in terms of Israel, but also in terms of foreign policy, where Biden is looking for successes on the world stage,” he said. “But it seems like there aren’t many.”</p>',	'2024-03-08 16:30:16.035',	NULL,	'US',	'The ‘special relationship’ under pressure: Are Biden and Netanyahu on a collision course over Gaza?

In 2023, plans to spend on industrial development came second to support for consumption.</p><p>“Unlike other economies that went through a wrenching adjustment in their housing market, China’s investment rate isn’t falling,” HSBC’s chief Asia economist Frederic Neumann and a team said in a report Friday. “Instead, [capital expenditure] is shifting towards infrastructure and, importantly, manufacturing.”</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>They noted how the shift “cushions the impact of a deflating property market on growth,” but also bears the same risk as over-investment in property.</p><p>“Unless demand keeps pace with investment, and does sustainably so, a harsh adjustment ultimately beckons,” HSBC economists said.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>Chinese authorities in 2020 intensified a crackdown on real estate developers’ high reliance on debt for growth. Property sales have since plunged while developers have run out of money to finish many projects, cutting into what was once about 25% of China’s GDP when including related sectors such as construction.</p><p>UBS analysts late last year estimated property now accounts for about 22% of the economy.</p><p>Despite widespread attention on whether Beijing would bail out the property sector, real estate got no mention in the finance ministry’s spending plans, and limited attention in a ministry-level press conference about the economy during the parliamentary meetings. Instead, the housing minister was included in the lineup for a press conference about people’s livelihoods.</p><p>“Supporting the modernization of the industrial system” came first in the finance ministry’s report, followed by “supporting the implementation of the strategy of invigorating China through science and education.”</p><p>Within that second priority, the finance ministry said it would allocate 31.3 billion yuan for improving vocational education. Amid high youth unemployment, especially for university graduates, electric car company BYD and battery maker CATL are among those working with vocational schools to train staff for their expanding workforce.</p><p>Support for consumption came third in the finance ministry’s priority list this year, with no monetary value listed.</p><p>The report from the National Development and Reform Commission, the top economic planner, reiterated government plans to support some developers’ financing needs — under the eighth item on the priority list that called for preventing financial risks. The government work report presented by Premier Li Qiang gave real estate a similar level of prominence.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Tech and industrial development by contrast received more attention, especially given the new political catchphrase “new productive forces” and strong emphasis on China’s leadership in electric cars.</p><p>China faces growing pressure from the U.S., which in the last two years has cut Chinese businesses off from the high-end semiconductors necessary for most advanced artificial intelligence training. While Chinese companies are working hard on developing their own high-end chips, analysts generally predict it will take at least a few years for China to catch up.</p><p>Pressure on tech comes as the world’s second-largest economy has slowed its pace of growth after double-digit increases in decades past. Beijing this week set a national growth target of around 5% for the year ahead, a goal many analysts called “ambitious” for the level of announced government stimulus.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>An increasing number of senior Chinese officials also come from an engineering background, particularly in aerospace.</p><p>One of those leaders with a rocket science background is Yuan Jiajun, who in October 2022 joined the Communist Party of China’s Politburo, the second-highest level of power. Yuan oversaw Chinese space missions in the early 2000s, including the first Chinese manned spaceflight mission called Shenzhou 5.</p><p>Late last year, Yuan also became party secretary of Chongqing, one of the biggest cities in China that often serves as a stepping stone to more senior roles. The municipality reports directly to the central government, as do Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.</p><p>Yuan told reporters Tuesday that in order for Chongqing to reach its goal of boosting economic growth by 1 trillion yuan in four years, the city must focus on bolstering manufacturing, followed by innovation in areas including artificial intelligence and high-end materials.</p><p>He described how the city has a plan for “Digital Chongqing,” which involves consolidating information about an industry — such as the car supply chain — onto one platform that can help the government allocate resources better. By building a digital system for daily tasks, Yuan said that can free up energy and brain power for more complex problems about the future.</p>',	'2024-03-08 16:30:16.061',	NULL,	'US',	'China doubles down on manufacturing, leaving real estate behind',	'https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107384633-1709878537859-gettyimages-1795737026-vcg111464586623.jpeg?v=1709878598&w=929&h=523&vtcrop=y'),

They’d have to buy new licenses, instead. Meanwhile, some software, including Office 365 Windows Apps, was forbidden from running on rival clouds.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The terms are the source of intense anger from competing cloud firms in Europe, like France’s OVHCloud and Italy’s Aruba, as well as Big Tech competitor Amazon. It also formed the basis of an investigation from the European Commission seeking to determine whether Microsoft’s cloud practices are anti-competitive.</p><p>Microsoft declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. In 2022, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote a blogpost saying it was revising its licensing deals and making it easier for cloud providers to compete.</p><p>In its complaint Friday, CISPE — which is heavily funded by Amazon — showed an example in its research where one member cloud firm, the name of which was not disclosed, saw revenues from selling Microsoft products including Windows Server, and SQL Server services climb over 300% since 2018, contributing to Microsoft’s own growth.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>But the growth of the unnamed cloud vendor’s profit margins didn’t match Microsoft’s, and in fact the competing cloud vendor saw their margins fall from a positive mid-twenties percentage in 2018 to double-digit negative profit margins in 2023.</p><p>The biggest decline in profit margins for this cloud firm occurred in 2019, the same year Microsoft changed its licensing terms to favor licensing software on Azure, the CISPE said. From 2019 to 2020, the CISPE member concerned saw their margin collapse from over 20% to zero.</p><p>CISPE also said that members shared evidence that the price they were charged for Microsoft’s SQL Server was much higher than the price quoted by Microsoft for customers using Azure.</p><p>For example, a company licensing Microsoft’s software for hosting and delivering their applications would have to pay 612.27 euros ($670) per 2-core SQL Server Enterprise product, 92.01 euros more than what Microsoft charges customers using Azure on average (520.26 euros), according to the CISPE’s data.</p><p>The complaint and the findings add to previous research from Frederic Jenny, a professor of economics at ESSEC Business School in Paris who specializes in competition law, for CISPE.

For years, family offices sought basic wealth preservation with traditional stocks-and-bonds portfolios. Now they’re more like institutional investors, seeking higher long-term returns with private equity, venture capital, hedge funds, infrastructure and real estate. Family offices have the highest allocation to hedge funds of any type of institutional investor, according to Preqin.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>Granted, the past two years have been tough on private equity, venture capital and many hedge fund returns.</p><p>More than half of the family offices that Preqin surveyed said they have been disappointed with their venture capital returns, while a third have been disappointed with private equity. Yet they remain hopeful for this year and beyond, with a majority saying private equity and venture capital will do better over the next 12 months.</p><p>Private equity firms are going after the family office market aggressively. Blackstone, which has served wealthy individuals for decades through its Private Wealth Solutions business, is ramping up its Private Capital Group, which serves family offices, billionaires and the largest, most sophisticated individual investors. That team has doubled to 25 people over the past few years and is likely to keep growing, according to Craig Russell, global head of Blackstone’s Private Capital Group.</p><p>“We view this as a substantial and growing opportunity for Blackstone,” Russell said.</p><p><em>Sign up to receive future editions of&nbsp;</em><em>CNBC’s Inside Wealth newsletter</em><em>&nbsp;with Robert Frank.</em></p>',	'2024-03-08 19:00:17.845',	NULL,	'US',	'Family offices have tripled since 2019, creating a new gold rush on Wall Street',	'https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107384317-1709843921393-gettyimages-1193063428-gusf02736.jpeg?v=1709848972&w=929&h=523&vtcrop=y'),

(212,	'',	'撤辣後發展商定價傾保守？　銀行收水停「摸貨」按揭｜鄭昆侖',	'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;據Knight Frank近期發表的的2024年度全球財富報告（Wealth Report），要進入某地區的最富有的1%一群，在新加坡的個人財富水平是要達到520萬美元，而香港的數字是310萬美元。作為對比，一年前（2023年度）新加坡當時的數字是350萬美元、而香港的數字是340萬美元。換句說話，在過去12個月新加坡總體上是多了很多有錢人（有可能他們將更多資金放進當地的銀行體系），又或者是的人均財富水平大幅提升。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;反過來說，貴為亞洲另一個傳統財富管理中心的香港，在2021至2023年其間面對股市以及樓市明顯貶值的情況。坊間有不少人很喜歡將大多數本地資產問題推到環球高息因素身上。重點是，在環球資金抽緊的大環境之下，為甚麼全球內有不少地方（又或者是行業）在過去1年仍然錄得資金流入、資產價格上升呢？<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;港府在2月28日宣佈取消額外印花稅（SSD、BSD、NRSD)之後，不論是地產發展商、地產代理、又或者是樓市炒家變得活躍。儘管當局撤辣初期有二手樓業主反價、封盤，又有一手樓發展商加速賣樓步伐，但是總體而言似乎樓價沒有明顯回升。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;據傳媒報導，有發展商就九龍灣新樓盤首批168伙，折實平均呎價14,808港元。最新呎價較今年初附近新盤開價低約3％。發展商形容是次作價為「東九龍震撼價」，原因是項目附近（黃大仙、馬頭角）今年年初新盤開價，每呎作價為15,000至18,400港元不等。附近二手屋苑呎價介乎15,000港元至20,000港元左右。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;相對於二手樓業主，一手樓發展商有較強的售樓能力。除了可以用高佣金的方式鼓勵地產代理幫手賣樓，也可以在售樓活動現場「造勢」。部份發展商會透過旗下的財務部門向買家提供首2至3年的融資。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;現時發展商的新盤定價似乎偏向保守，亦反映不少地產商的重點仍是套現為主。即使是債務比率水平不算重而且旗下商場仍提供可靠現金流的新地（0016），在2024財年也削減中期股息至0.95港元（由一年前的1.25港元）。相比之下，一般個體戶的債務比率是高很多（7成樓宇按揭成數等同233%的「債務/本金」比率），因此發展商近15個月偏向減價的做法似乎不利於二手樓業主。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;另一個因素值得留意的是，即使金管局似乎透過放寬壓力測試鼓勵市民以高槓桿的方式（例如7至9成按揭成數）去買樓，但是本地銀行似乎偏向收緊放貸。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;舉例說，在當局撤辣不久，坊間便有人吹捧「摸貨」短炒。有人估計，計入稅務因素，300至400萬港元價位的單位比較上合適。由於這類型炒賣方式涉及在短時間的「擁有權轉手」，因此比較上適合經驗老手、行業中人（例如地產代理）。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;除此之外，摸貨炒賣的「潛在高回報」亦需要獲得銀行貸款。如果是Full Pay投資, 那麼一般預期樓價由低位反彈5%至10%的情況，遠不及買賣藍籌股票那麼間單方便。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;問題是，市傳指多家本地銀行停做「摸貨」按揭，亦意味承接摸貨的下一手買家，或者未能承造按揭。在以上情況下，接貨的新買家只可以Full Pay的方式向炒家買入單位，因此一般正常買家不會買入該類單位，亦打擊了相關的客路。不排除有摸貨炒家已經「短炒變長揸，Strong Hold是也」。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;如果買家在簽訂臨時買賣合約時，發覺賣方姓名不同於土地註冊處的土地查冊紀錄中的註冊業主姓名，這樣便有可能賣方是以確認人身份出售物業（亦極有可能是摸貨炒家）。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;銀行收緊借貸，不單止是出現在上述的摸貨按揭。即使是銀行的私人貸宣傳廣告，所涉的貸款利率（APR)亦不斷調升。今年2月初的APR仍是7厘左右，近日已升至約8厘水平。在2023年，當時APR是5至6厘左右。更不用說，在2022年上半年當時的APR亦只不過是2.4至3.0厘左右。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;我們不能忽略一個現實，不論是地產商還是銀行，都是在套現或收緊銀根（儘管不少人跟你說息口已見頂）。如果銀行調高借貸的風險溢價（Risk Premium），那麼即使是環球息口見頂也不等於借錢成本會下降。所以呢，借錢買樓又或者是為了其他目的，都是「還得到先好借」，千祈唔好「將借貸當成收入」。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;作者介紹：筆者 Albert (分析員的告白 / Albert Analyst)為特許財務分析師﹙CFA﹚，從事投資行業十多年，包括買方研究分析、獨立股評分析等工作。Albert的投資（投機）理念是尋找鮮為人知的宏觀以至行業趨勢，在人群未湧入前買入「優質資產」。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>免責聲明︰</strong>以上內容僅代表作者的個人立場和觀點，不代表香港01的任何立場，香港01亦無法核實上述內容的真實性、準確性和原創性。<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;另外，以上純屬個人研究分享，並不代表任何第三方機構立場，亦非任何投資建議或勸誘。讀者務請運用個人獨立思考能力自行作出投資決定。',	'2024-03-10 01:58:17.900',	NULL,	'HKEX',	'撤辣後發展商定價傾保守？　銀行收水停「摸貨」按揭｜鄭昆侖',	'https://cdn.hk01.com/di/media/images/dw/20240310/843413757274099712930674.jpeg/QE8ZHOjH0m7dZcK6ObfCuvk82y8m2Ib_ShiLZUoYi2U?v=w1920r16_9'),

Many voters have not expressed happiness at the prospect of a Trump-Biden rematch, bracing for a potentially cruel summer and fall campaign&nbsp;season as the contenders’ bad blood risks stoking further polarization in the country’s politics.</p><p>“What we need is a very strong middle,” Dalio said at a financial forum in November.</p><p>“We have irreconcilable differences by sides that will not accept losing.”</p><p>He said at the time that he saw former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, as the most promising candidate. Perhaps he now hopes Swift will fill in the blank space left by Haley’s recent departure from the race.</p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The Eras Tour is the most profit-generating concert tour in history, spanning 152 shows in five continents over 21 months.</p><p>Since launching her tour, Swift has become a billionaire and boosted the economies of numerous cities and states, surpassing many forecasters’ wildest dreams. The U.S. Federal Reserve in 2023 cited her concerts as providing significant economic boosts to American cities, and some analysts estimated that by October of that year, the shows and subsequent gold rush of travel and spending by fans had added $5.7 billion to the U.S. economy.</p><p>In Singapore alone, six consecutive days of concerts are estimated to have added between $225 million to $300 million to the city-state’s economy in the first quarter of this year, according to a survey of economists published by Bloomberg.</p>',	'2024-03-10 14:26:58.363',	NULL,	'US',	'Ray Dalio says Taylor Swift should be president, posts Eras Tour selfie',	'https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107384758-1709904046212-Untitled-3.jpg?v=1709904145&w=929&h=523&vtcrop=y'),

Hopes for a new cease-fire by Ramadan faded days ago with negotiations apparently stalled.</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>The opening of the sea corridor, along with airdrops by the U.S., Jordan and others, showed growing alarm over Gaza’s deadly humanitarian crisis and a new willingness to bypass Israeli control over land shipments. Israel said that it welcomed the sea deliveries and would inspect Gaza-bound cargo before it leaves a staging area in nearby Cyprus.</p><p>But aid officials say that air and sea deliveries can’t make up for a shortage of supply routes on land. The daily number of aid trucks entering Gaza by land over the past five months has been far below the 500 that entered before the war.</p><p>A ship belonging to Spanish aid group Open Arms and carrying 200 tons of food aid was expected to make a pilot voyage to test the corridor “as soon as possible,” said spokesperson Linda Roth with partner organization World Central Kitchen. The ship remained at Cyprus’ port of Larnaca in what Roth called “a quickly evolving and fluid situation.”</p><p>Biden stepped up public criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he believes that Netanyahu is “hurting Israel more than helping Israel” in his approach to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, now in its sixth month.</p><p>Speaking Saturday to MSNBC, the U.S. president expressed support for Israel’s right to pursue Hamas after the militants’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, but said that Netanyahu “must pay more attention to the innocent lives being lost.” He added that “you cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead.”</p><div style=\"height:100%\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div><p>The Health Ministry in Gaza said that at least 31,045 Palestinians have been killed since the war began. The ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count, but says that women and children make up two-thirds of the dead. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, and its figures from previous wars have largely matched those of U.N. and independent experts.</p><p>Palestinian casualties continued to rise. The Civil Defense Department said that at least nine Palestinians, including children, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza City late Saturday. Footage that it shared showed one rescuer placing the body of a dead infant on a sofa amid the wreckage.</p><p>Elsewhere, the bodies of 15 people, including women and children, were taken to the main hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah on Sunday, according to an Associated Press journalist. Relatives said they were killed by Israeli artillery fire toward a tent camp for displaced Palestinians in the coastal area near the southern city of Khan Younis.</p><p>Israel rarely comments on specific incidents during the war. It maintains that Hamas is responsible for civilian casualties because the militant group operates from within civilian areas.</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. efforts began to set up the temporary pier in Gaza for sea deliveries. U.S. Central Command said the first U.S. Army vessel, the General Frank S. Besson, left a base in Virginia on Saturday and was on its way to the Eastern Mediterranean with equipment for construction.</p><p>U.S. officials said that it would likely be weeks before the pier is operational.</p><p>The sea corridor is backed by the European Union together with the United States, the United Arab Emirates and other countries. The European Commission has said that U.N. agencies and the Red Cross will play a role.</p><p>The ship in Cyprus is expected to take two to three days to arrive at an undisclosed location. The World Central Kitchen spokesperson said that construction work began Sunday on the jetty for it at an undisclosed location in Gaza.</p><p>A member of the charity said on X, formerly Twitter, that once the ship’s barge reaches Gaza, aid would be offloaded by a crane, placed on trucks and driven to northern Gaza, which has been largely cut off from aid shipments and was the first focus of Israel’s military offensive.</p><p>Israel declared war on Oct. 7 after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostages. Israel’s air and ground offensive has devastated large parts of Gaza and displaced about 80% of the population of 2.3 million.</p><p>The U.S. and regional mediators Egypt and Qatar had hoped to have a six-week cease-fire in place by Ramadan, but Hamas is holding out for assurances that a temporary truce will lead to an end of hostilities.</p><p>Mediators had hoped to alleviate some of the immediate crisis with the temporary cease-fire, which would have seen Hamas release some Israeli hostages, Israel release some Palestinian prisoners and aid groups be given access to a major influx of assistance into Gaza.</p>',	'2024-03-10 13:46:49.902',	NULL,	'US',	'A U.S. ship with equipment for building a pier is on its way to Gaza as part of a plan to ramp up aid',	'https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107383524-17097553872024-03-06t151457z_328464213_rc27g6ay1qpa_rtrmadp_0_israel-palestinians.jpeg?v=1709755407&w=929&h=523&vtcrop=y');
